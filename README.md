# MercuryProject_Honours

This is my Honours Project for 4th year of studying Computer Science at Robert Gordon University. 

This follows the development and implementation of an application, for the Cults, Miltimber and Bielside Community Council, which will push notifcations to the community and alert them of adverse weather conditions, such as flooding, and other disturbances, such as criminal acts.
